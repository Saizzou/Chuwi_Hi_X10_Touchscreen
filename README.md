# Chuwi_Hi_X10_Touchscreen
Touchscreen and Screen Turning Script for Chuwi Hi X10!

This Script is written in Shell Script! The Script was tested by me on:
Kali Linux 2020.4 \
Debian 10 with a 4.19 Kernel \
Debian 10 with a 5.8 Kernel \
Linux Mint 20

Feel Free to Pull or Push!

Instalation:
$ sudo  sh -c "$(wget https://github.com/Saizzou/Chuwi_Hi_X10_Touchscreen/blob/main/horizontal.sh)"


With My Screen Turner Script you will be able to Turn the Screen and Touch Screen Recognition
 when using the Keyboard. The Screen and Touch Recognition will turn Vertical if you plug in 
a Keyboard. If you detach the Keyboard the Screen and the Touch Screen Recognition will turn back
to horizontal state.

You can use seperately the Turning Scripts if you want to use the Turning Functions without a
automation!
